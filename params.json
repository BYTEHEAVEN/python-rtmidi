{"name":"python-rtmidi","tagline":"Python bindings for the cross-platform MIDI I/O library RtMidi","body":"Welcome to python-rtmidi!\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n[RtMidi][1] is a set of C++ classes which provides a concise and simple,\r\ncross-platform API (Application Programming Interface) for realtime MIDI\r\ninput/output across Linux (ALSA & JACK), Macintosh OS X (CoreMidi & JACK),\r\nand Windows (Multimedia Library) operating systems.\r\n\r\n**python-rtmidi**is a Python binding for RtMidi implemented with [Cython][2] and\r\nprovides a thin wrapper around the RtMidi C++ interface. The API is basically\r\nthe same as the C++ one but with the naming scheme of classes, methods and\r\nparameters adapted to the Python PEP-8 conventions and requirements of\r\nthe Python package naming structure. **python-rtmidi** supports Python 2\r\n(tested with Python 2.7) and Python 3 (3.3, 3.4).\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit **python-rtmidi's** web page:\r\n\r\nhttp://chrisarndt.de/projects/python-rtmidi\r\n\r\nSee the file `INSTALL.rst` for installation instructions, `CHANGELOG.rst`\r\nfor a history of changes per release and `LICENSE.txt` for information about\r\ncopyright and usage terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/index.html\r\n[2]: http://cython.org/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
